Production App hosted at ForThePeople.Vote

## Goal
Create transparency in our government and holding all elected officials in America accountable for representing the people they serve rather than personal interests.

## Purpose
Empower the American electorate to fairly evaluate how well their elected officials are representing them by providing accurate, timely detail on the measures receiving attention, the representatives who are voting, and how they are voting.

## Values
Honest
Non partisan
Simple
Convenient 
Timely

## Execution Status and Timeline
### March 12th
The app will be functional for friends and family. Website design will still be barebones, but the weekly email with Member of Congress voting history from the previous week will be live.

### March 27th
Beta release - Logo/Website will be ready for users to sign-up and manage their profiles online. The focus at this stage will still be on making the email presentable and usable.

### April 18th
Official Launch.
